1) What is the difference between JDK and JRE?

   JDK stands for Java Development Kit, which is a software development environment for building Java applications.
   JRE stands for Jave Runtime Environment, which is require to run Java programs.

2) Why is Java a platform independent language?

   By relying on a virtual machine, Java achieves platform independence. 
   In practice, this means that both the Java programming language and it's associated APIs are first compiled bytecodes that can run on multiple platforms.
   Then, the virtual machine handles any variations in how these bytecodes are executed across different platforms.
